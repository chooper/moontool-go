# moontool.go

Calculate the moon phase^Wage for a given date.

So here's the deal, this has been ported from [moon.py][1] by Kevin Turner
which in turn was ported from [moontool.c][2] by John Walker. I don't
actually understand any of the math very well, so in this package's current
state, it's a line-by-line port-of-a-port.
